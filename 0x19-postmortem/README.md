Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident

Issue Summary:

Duration:
Start Time: January 15, 2024, 10:00 AM (UTC)
End Time: January 15, 2024, 2:00 PM (UTC)
Impact:
The outage affected our main web application service, resulting in a 30% degradation of service for users globally.
Root Cause:
A misconfigured update to the load balancer caused a surge in traffic to a single server, overwhelming its resources and leading to service degradation.
Timeline:

10:15 AM: Issue detected through automated monitoring alerts indicating a spike in error rates and latency.

10:30 AM: Initial investigation began, focusing on the application server logs and infrastructure metrics.

11:00 AM: Assumed root cause to be an application code issue due to recent deployment. Deploy rollback initiated.

11:30 AM: No improvement observed after rollback. Investigation expanded to database servers and network configurations.

12:00 PM: Misleading assumption that the issue might be related to a recent database migration. Database team engaged.

12:30 PM: As the issue persisted, suspicion shifted to the load balancer. Load balancer logs analyzed.

1:00 PM: Load balancer misconfiguration identified as the root cause. Incident escalated to network and infrastructure teams.

1:30 PM: Load balancer configuration corrected. Service recovery initiated.

2:00 PM: Web application service fully restored. Incident closed.

Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause:

The load balancer, trying to be the DJ of the internet party, played a solo beat, directing all traffic to one server. That server threw in the towel.
Resolution:

We sat the load balancer down, had a heart-to-heart, and fixed its playlist. Load balancing algorithms were reprogrammed, and monitoring systems were given a stern talking to.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Things to Improve/Fix:

Automated Configuration Checks: Load balancer now has a checklist before joining the party, ensuring it wonâ€™t hog the dance floor.

Redundancy Measures: Servers now have buddies to cover for them if they decide to take an impromptu vacation.
Tasks to Address the Issue:

Load Balancer Configuration Review: Conduct a thorough review of load balancer configurations to ensure accuracy and prevent similar misconfigurations.

Monitoring Enhancements: Improve monitoring systems to provide more granular insights into load balancer performance and alert on anomalies.

Documentation Update: Document load balancer configuration best practices and ensure that all team members are aware of proper configuration procedures.

Training Session: Conduct a training session to educate the team on identifying and troubleshooting load balancer issues.

Incident Response Review: Evaluate the incident response process to identify areas for improvement, including faster escalation paths and communication protocols.

This postmortem outlines the timeline, root cause, resolution, and corrective/preventative measures taken in response to the recent web stack outage. By implementing these improvements, we aim to fortify our infrastructure against similar incidents and enhance the overall reliability of our service.
